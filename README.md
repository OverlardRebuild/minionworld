Welcome to the <Minion World> project.
This projects aims to reverse engineer and recreate a popular, real-time, party-based RPG game (can you guess which one?).

The project is split along the following sub-projects:

RE_Textures
During this subpr we try to find a way to detach the textures and meshes from the game and restack them in a different database.

RE_Scripting
During this subpr, the goal is to find out what scripting languages have been used for defining the gameplay
 
MapShard
Here, the foundations will be made to call the different maps to the game client.

Gameplay_GUI
This subpr aims to setup the MinionWorld GUI. 
 
 
Gameplay_Logic
This subpr aims to replicate the gameplay scripting, via implementing the various game mechanics.

Gameplay_Quests
Polishes up the game's questlines and interactions. May be split in _quests and _npcs.


More to come soon!
